Fascinated by material science, I run a small sewing business and regularly analyze the data that results from thousands of destructive product tests. Recent graduate of the Sydney University Coding Certificate and already applying both frontend and backend knowledge to my own website and that of the Australian Slacklining Association. Proficient in Javascript, API’s, SQL along with a host of npm packages (Sequelize, Express, Node.js, etc).
